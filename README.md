Foraging for new physics: machine learning-based, model-agnostic new physics searches at the 40 MHz Scouting system of CMS.

What does this mean?

I am currently exploring different isotree settings for outlier detection on a Monte Carlo dataset that aims at simulating the data at Level-1 Trigger. Different signals to be benchmarked as our "new physics" (==outliers/anomalies).
